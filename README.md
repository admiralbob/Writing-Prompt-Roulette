# Writing Prompt Roulette 🖋️✨

An interactive writing prompt generator designed for aspiring writers and creative writing groups. This tool uses a "roulette-style" triple-spinner to generate unique combinations of **Genre**, **Scenario**, and **Character Tasks**.

## 🚀 Features
* **Three-Way Randomizer:** Spin for a Genre (with descriptions), a Scenario (hooks), and a Character (with specific tasks).
* **Export Function:** Once you find a prompt you like, you can download it as a `.txt` file to reference while you write.
* **PWA Ready:** Includes a `manifest.json` and custom icon, allowing you to "Add to Home Screen" on iPhone and Android to use it like a native mobile app.

## 📖 How to Use
1.  **Spin:** Click the "SPIN THE WHEELS" button to randomize the fields.
2.  **Generate:** Watch the animations settle on a unique prompt.
3.  **Save:** Click "DOWNLOAD AS TXT" to keep a copy of your challenge.

## 🛠️ The Prompt Lists
This tool focuses on universal, high-concept storytelling:
* **Genres:** Ranges from *Gothic Horror* to *Cosy Mystery*, each with a helpful lens for the writer.
* **Scenarios:** Includes hooks like the "Object with Empathy" and "Language Barriers."
* **Characters & Tasks:** Provides active archetypes like *The Newcomer* or *The Messenger* with specific goals to drive the plot.
